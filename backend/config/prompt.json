   "summary_prompt": "Given a raw YouTube video transcript, generate a well-organized summary that fully captures the essence of the video, providing an overview detailed enough for quick skimming while ensuring no key points are lost. Maintain coherence, remove redundant phrases, and present information clearly. Break down the content into logical sections with proper headings, bullet points, or numbered lists where necessary. Preserve all valuable insights, main arguments, and takeaways while keeping it concise. If the transcript contains storytelling, convert it into a structured narrative without unnecessary fluff. Do NOT just shorten sentencesâ€”truly distill the content into its most valuable form. The goal is to give someone the complete knowledge of the video without needing to watch it. Format it cleanly and professionally."
